## ZOOKEEPER SETUP ##

-- Download Zookeeper from Apache website
-- Not all versions will work, the version below has been tested and works
-- Note: The address may have changed, google "download Zookeeper 3.4.14" to get latest version

wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.4.14/zookeeper-3.4.14.tar.gz

--untar

tar -xzf zookeeper-3.4.14.tar.gz

-- change to zookeeper and conf directory

cd zookeeper-3.4.14/conf


--Configure zoo.cfg	

cp zoo_sample.cfg zoo.cfg


-- Open zoo.cfg
-- Note if you are using a Linux system without graphics, you cannot use gedit, you must use an inline text editor like vi or nano
-- Look up some tutorials on these editors, for example here is one on vi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU2k776i2Zw

vi zoo.cfg (only for GCP or sever based machines)

-- make sure you have at the end of the file: server.0=127.0.0.1:2888:3888
-- Change data directory to /var/zookeeper

--Create Zookeeper directory

sudo mkdir /var/zookeeper

-- Chaning ownership to local user, you need to replace username with your actual username
-- username is what comes before the @ sign in your terminal

sudo chown a_ashish5296:a_ashish5296 /var/zookeeper


-- Create myid
-- enter server number.  First server has number "0" so put "0" in myid file
-- Server number should match server in zoo.cfg

vi /var/zookeeper/myid


-- Start Zookeeper
-- Change to Zookeeper directory and then

bin/zkServer.sh start

-- You should get a message Starting zookeeper ... STARTED
-- You can choose start-foreground to get more information (if it does not start)

## KAFKA SETUP ##

-- Download Kafka distribution from Confluent
-- kind of like cloudera for Hadoop
-- Former engineers from LinkedIn
-- download using ONE of the following link

wget https://packages.confluent.io/archive/4.1/confluent-4.1.4-2.11.tar.gz

-- or alternatively

wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/vb09hq3oikwy7dn/confluent-4.1.4-2.11.tar

--untar

tar -xzf confluent-4.1.4-2.11.tar.gz 

-- Configuration
-- change to Confluent directory and change the following files

vi etc/kafka/server.properties

-- Make sure that you broker.id = 0  (should match server ID, by default it is zero but double check)
-- make sure you have zookeeper.connect = localhost:2181  (host name and ports)

vi etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties


-- Make sure dataDir = /var/zookeeper


-- Start Kafka with log files to make sure that it is running property

bin/kafka-server-start etc/kafka/server.properties

-- Make sure you don't get any errors (server doesn't shut down)
-- If it does shut down, try to figure out what is wrong

-- Start Kafka broker without log-files
-- lots of log files, dumping it to the abiss
-- nohup allows you to run the service in background

nohup bin/kafka-server-start etc/kafka/server.properties > /dev/null 2>&1 &

-- check out logs to make sure there is no errors (under confluence directory)

-- If you want to stop Kafka server

bin/kafka-server-stop
